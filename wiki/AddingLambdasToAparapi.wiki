#summary Adding Lambdas to Aparapi

I have been playing with Java 8 lambdas  http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/ for a couple of days and tinkering with a possible Aparapi API. 

I have created a branch called 'MockLambdas' to track my ideas. 

You will need to get the latest binary build of lambdas to make the code in this branch work (check the accept license box!) http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/

Then hack the {{{lambda.bat}}} file in the root dir to point to your installation. All other bat files in 'MockLambdas' use 'lambda.bat' so you should only have to hack one file. 

Then 
  build.bat

and
  run.bat 

Should do what you expect ;)
